# Om-GitAI: Conversational GitHub Automation CLI

Om-GitAI is a powerful AI-powered command-line tool that allows developers to interact with GitHub using natural language. Built with TypeScript, OpenAI GPT-4o, and GitHub REST APIs, this CLI enables voice-like DevOps workflows.

---

## 🚀 What is Om-GitAI?

Om-GitAI is your AI assistant for automating GitHub workflows directly from the terminal. Just speak to it in plain English:

```sh
Om-GitAI "create a private repo named ai-pipeline"
```

Om-GitAI will parse your instruction, generate a structured JSON command using GPT-4o, and perform the GitHub operation using secure API requests.

---

## 💡 Why Use Om-GitAI?

- Eliminate repetitive GitHub tasks
- No need to remember GitHub CLI commands or REST API endpoints
- Focus more on code, less on DevOps overhead
- Boost developer productivity with LLM-powered command execution

---

## 🛠 Supported Commands

You can execute tasks like:

- ✅ Create repositories (public/private)
- ✅ Push code to branches with commit messages
- ✅ Create new branches from source branches
- ✅ Open pull requests between branches
- ✅ List all your GitHub repositories
- ✅ Analyze any file’s content or functions using AI
- ✅ Read code from any file in a GitHub repo
- ✅ Look over recent commits and functions
- ✅ Answer DevOps, GitHub, or code-related questions

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You input a natural language command
2. GPT-4o transforms it into a structured JSON action
3. The CLI securely executes the GitHub API request

**Example:**

```sh
Om-GitAI "create a pull request from dev to main in repo github-cli titled Add auth layer"
```

---

## 🔍 Complex Prompt Examples

```sh
Om-GitAI "read code from src/index.ts in today repo on branch 28-May"
Om-GitAI "summarize what the utils/logger.ts file does in repo githubAutoCLI"
Om-GitAI "what functions are defined in api.js on branch staging"
Om-GitAI "create a new branch feature/payment from main in repo checkout-api"
```
